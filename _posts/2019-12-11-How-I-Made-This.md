I made this site using Jekyll, using the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme.

I gave Hugo a try - it was ending up taking too much time. Too many files to install, settings to configure, et caetera.

Looking to improve this site as I go. Will hopefully make for a good learning opportunity.
